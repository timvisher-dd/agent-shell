# Agent Shell - Project Guidelines

## Communication norms

PR and issue conversations are human relationships. The maintainer prefers
talking directly to humans.

When contributing:

- Write your own PR descriptions and issue comments. Don't have AI generate them.
- If you used AI to research something, summarize the findings in your own words
  and give your level of endorsement rather than pasting AI output verbatim.
  Concise, human-written summaries save the maintainer from having to parse
  lengthy generated text.
- Review all code in your PR yourself and vouch for its quality.
